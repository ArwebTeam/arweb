# arweb

Arweb is a module that allows building serverless, dynamic applications upon arweave

# What does it do?

It launches a service worker than can expose APIs to the client,
provide real-time synchronisation accross the arweave network using arcache
and allow building CRUD-based APIs on top of arweave in mere minutes using arcrud

# How to use it?

First, create your service worker:

```
```

# TODO
 - arcrud CLI
 - arweb deploy --app-id $ID
 - app identification
 - "dezentralized loading of apps" by embedding the app code into arweave
